# Adobe Fonts Cache Tool

I got tired of Adobe Fonts constantly deactivating fonts I was using in Figma, and the mind-bogglingly high resource usage of the Adobe Creative Cloud app, so I made a tool to copy my fonts out of the cache folder. This tool only works on Windows, but could probably be easily ported to Mac OS if you replace a couple of path names.

Please don't use this for anything nefarious.
